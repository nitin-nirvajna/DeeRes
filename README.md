# DeepRes: Advanced Research & Guides for AI Agents and Mobile Technology

## Project Overview
DeepRes is a curated collection of research reports and practical guides focused on the latest advancements in AI agentic systems, small language models (SLMs), and next-generation mobile technologies. The project aims to bridge theory and practice, providing actionable insights for developers, researchers, and industry professionals.

## Contents
- **index.html**: Main landing page for navigating all research topics.
- **dee_res/**: Contains individual, self-contained HTML reports:
  - `dee_res1.html`: 6G Mobile Technology—AI Features with Small LLMs
  - `dee_res2.html`: Building AI Agents with Claude, MCP, and Modern Tooling
  - `dee_res3.html` to `dee_res5.html`: Additional topics (open-source 5G/6G, agentic workflows, orchestration, etc.)
  - `style.css`: Unified styling for all reports

## Key Features & Topics
- **Agentic Systems**: In-depth guides on building scalable, maintainable AI agents using direct API calls, Model Context Protocol (MCP), and best practices from Anthropic and the broader community.
- **Mobile AI**: Exploration of SLM-powered features for 6G networks, device-edge-cloud synergy, and proactive network optimization.
- **Tooling & Frameworks**: Comparisons and hands-on instructions for Claude Code, LangChain, Amazon Bedrock, and open-source MCP servers.
- **Security & Governance**: Coverage of modern authorization standards (OAuth 2.1, PKCE), RBAC/ABAC, and privacy considerations for agentic architectures.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Patterns for orchestrator-worker systems, parallelization, and hierarchical agent design.
- **Best Practices**: Practical advice for debugging, logging, prompt engineering, and environment setup.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser to access the main navigation.
2. Select any report to dive into a specific topic. Each HTML file is standalone and styled for clarity.
3. Follow code samples and step-by-step guides for hands-on experimentation (e.g., setting up Claude Code, running MCP servers, integrating tools).

## Dependencies & Setup
- Reports are static HTML and CSS—no build required.
- For code samples (Python, Node.js):
  - Install [Anthropic Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/anthropic/) and [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) for agent demos.
  - Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+) and run `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` for Claude Code CLI.
  - Use `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem .` to start a local MCP server for file access.
